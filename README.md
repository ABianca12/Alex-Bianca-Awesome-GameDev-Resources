# Philosophy

This repository aims to be practical, and it will be updated as we test the methodology. Frame it as a guidebook, not a manual. Most of the time, we are constrained by the time, so in order to move fast, we won't cover deeply some topics, but the basics that allows you to explore by yourself or point the directions for you to study in other places acting as a self-taught student, so you really should look for more information elsewhere if you feels so. I use lots of references and highly incentive you to look for other too and propose changes in this repo. Sometimes, it will mostly presented in a chaotic way, which implies that you will need to explore the concepts by yourself or read the manual/books. Every student should follow your own path to learning, it is impossible to cover every learning style, so it is up to you to build your own path and discover the best way to learn. What worked for me or what works for a given student probably won't work for you, so dont compare yourself to others too much, but be assured that we're here to help you to succeed. If you need help, just send private messages, or use public forums such as github issues and discussions.
