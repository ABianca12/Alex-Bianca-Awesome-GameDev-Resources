# Min-Max Algorithm

Commonly while you build a tree of options, (say path, decisions, states or anything else), you will have to make a decision at each node of the tree to deepen the search. The min-max algorithm is a nice and easy approach to solve this problem. It might be used in games, decision making, and other fields.

## Use cases

Min-Max algorithms shines in places where you will have to maximize the gain and minimize the loss.
