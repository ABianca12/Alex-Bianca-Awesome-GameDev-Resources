# Procedural Content Generation

Procedural content generation is a broad topic, and we need to narrow down some applications and algorithms to cover. I carefully covered Maze generation and Scenario Generation here https://github.com/InfiniBrains/mobagen and I invite you to check the examples named `maze` and `scenario`. Besides that, Amit Patel have a really nice website focused in many game algorithms, check it out and support his work https://www.redblobgames.com/

Please refer to the book below. We are going to follow the contents mostly from it.
