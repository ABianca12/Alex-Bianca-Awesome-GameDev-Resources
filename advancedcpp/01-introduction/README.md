# Introduction to Advanced Programming

## Course Description

This course builds on the content from Introduction to Programming. Students study the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm with topics such as objects, classes, encapsulation, abstraction, modularity, inheritance, and polymorphism. Students examine and use structures such as arrays, structs, classes, and linked lists to model complex information. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation are covered, as well as principles such as overloading and overriding. Students work to solve problems by selecting implementation options from competing alternatives.

# Recapitulation

## Memory Allocation

In the previous course, we covered memory allocation via `new` and `delete`, and where the data is being stored, i.e. the stack and the heap. We also covered the difference between the two, and how to use them.

## Pointers
