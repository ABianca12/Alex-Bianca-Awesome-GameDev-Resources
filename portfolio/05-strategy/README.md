# Strategies for Social Networks

All social networks uses some type of relevance algorithm to promote your content or profile. So you have to find means to increase your relevance. Most of the algorithms measure your relevance by number of reactions(likes, follows, comments, replies...), so every time you post something, you should try to incentive the content consumers to do that.

## Google
If your aim is to be relevant on Google, try to check the trending words people are searching now via [Google trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore). 

If you follow this path, the main strategy is the common SEO optimization techniques. Here goes some guides to help you nail that.

If you are a prolific writer and really into it. You can try to make wikipedia refer you and raise your rate on google algorithm. You can query google `site:wikipedia.org [your niche keyword] + "dead link"` and check the pages that are missing references to your content, then edit the wikipedia page to refer your website or blog post to give sources for something missing. 

## Linkedin

- Consistency is the key. You have to post frequently. Period. 
- Follow other professionals in your field and check what they are posting to try replicate their behavior.
- Follow companies you want to work
- Connect with the hiring personal from the companies you want to work for, so when they search for people, you will be on the top suggestions.

# Activity

Submit your portfolio on class and Review 2 portfolios.

1. What game do you liked the most? Watch its credits on youtube. Pay attention to the job position names. Find the one you find it most suitable for you. Optionally, connect with some names on linkedin that you find on credits section. If the game dont have a credits section on youtube, just search for its name on linkedin and search for the peoples names that are working on it and the company job openings.
2. Log in anonymously to the link shared in class if you want to not expose yourself(I think it is the best way to be honest and not expose yourself).
3. On the second page, write your portfolio URL (or WiP repository for your demos) and the job position you want to apply so others can evaluate your work. If you dont have one yet, just evaluate the others.
4. Chose 2 portfolios and prefer to evaluate portfolios with less evaluations. For each evaluation, create a new Page and add a page break using Control Enter or via interface insert pagebreak.
5. In this page write as H1 text format the portfolio URL, so it can be indexed
6. Evaluate at least 2 portfolios, following this [Example](../02-cases/example.com.md). Be kind and constructive.
7. You as the owner of the portfolio evaluated, you are allowed to delete offenses or bad words from the evaluation. If you want to interact with the content generated anonymously about your portfolio, use comments logged with your account.
