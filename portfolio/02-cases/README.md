# Activity 1
This class is totally up to you. Here goes what you should do in class and finish at home. 

1. Search a good portfolio published online
    - use Twitter, LinkedIn, Google to search for good game developer portfolios;
    - another good query on google would be "awesome developer portfolio", or "curated list of developer portfolios" try it!
2. Fork this repo
3. Create a markdown file in this folder with a meaningful name about the benchmarked repository.
    - Follow this [example](example.com.md)
    - The file name should be the website domain name followed by .md
    - If another student is aiming to evaluate the same portfolio, just edit the file adding your evaluation to the text.
4. Your file should contain:
    - A summary
    - The portfolio evaluated
    - The date the evaluation happened
    - Print-screens uploaded to image hosting services such as [imgur](https://imgur.com/) or others
    - What things you judge as good and you are aiming to follow and target
    - What things you judge that needs attention and should be improved
    - Why you would hire the owner of the portfolio
    - General considerations
5. Edit [this file](README.md) on github to link your work here if you want to showcase it here.
6. Send a push request

# Activity 2

Start setting up your Github pages. We are going to use github pages mostly for two intentions: Webpage hosting for your portfolio and Demo project hosting.

For your webpage you can create something from ground up our follow any template you want. Here goes a bunch of open sourced developer portfolios you can fork and modify for your intent. https://github.com/topics/developer-portfolio?l=html . Try to take a look on them and check if you want to fork any of them.

For project hosting
