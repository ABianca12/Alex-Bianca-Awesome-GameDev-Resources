# Game Developer Structure

Create a single page app containing most of these features listed here.

## HEAD
Chose carefully what to you use as a head of your page. It is the first thing a person reads. It can be an impactful message, personal statement, background video or very limited interactive section.

## About
This is a summary obout yourself, be brief and achievement oriented. What and who you are. Contact info via social 
medias. State your working status and target. If you are a narrative centred person, you can create something fancy 
here, but dont over-do, less is more!

## Showcase
- Projects
- Ability and versatility
- Community Contributions

You can showcase your personal work, a job you make for a client(if authorized).

## Achievements
- List key achievements and skills
- Education
- Testimonials or anything to prove your skills and capacity

## Project Detail
- You should create a way to explain more about what is showcased

## Blog
- Featured posts/content and call to action to read your ongoing content production
- Explain your process in designing a game or piece of software
- Explain some interesting details you learn or describe your knowledge explorations.

## Contact
Explicitly state what people should expect if they contact you and what they can expect from your return. Ex.: If 
you aim to be a freelance, state your offer and ask for them to briefly state the job activity, time frame and the rate 
they are willing to pay. 

Another option is to list all of your social medias, but dont overuse this. Nowadays we have bunch of them, so if 
you list all of them, there is chances, you are not active there and the link will guide the reader to a empty and 
haunted house and they will not engage.

# Homework

- Set your goal as your portfolio. 
- Create a wireframe draft of what you are going to do on [figma](https://www.figma.com/) or any other tool you find relevant.
