# Introduction

### Do you need a portfolio?
It is not only about you, it is about maxing the life of the others easier by giving insights if they should hire you, 
follow you or anything else. In order to make people understand you, you have to know yourself better. So...

## Who are you?

Discover who you are, what you excel, and what do you really enjoy doing. I will be briefly vague here to 
point some emotional support and reasoning to help you answer the question. If you are clear about that, please skip 
this entire section. Here goes a small amount of advices I wish I have heard when I was young.

You are a complex being and hard to define. I know. It is hard to put yourself in a frame or box, but this process is 
relevant to make the life of the others to evaluate if they want more you or not. If for some reason a person is 
reading your portfolio, it means that you are ahead of the others, so you must to respect their time and goals while 
they are reading your content.

What you do, do not define what you are, you can even work with something you dont love as long it is part of a bigger 
plan. Given that, you have to know how to differentiate yourself from your work while respecting your 
feelings. The sweet spot is when you mix who you are with what you do, and you have nice feelings about it. But this 
can be hard to achieve and require maturity to mix things. If you dont have a clear understand of those aspects of 
yourself, you will be subjected to be exploited by bad companies and managers.

It is totally fine try to excel some job you are not passionate. You just have to find means to make your time 
doing it as enjoyable as possible. In the end of the journey it will slowly become something you can be proud of, 
and you will become a different person than the one you are now. Understanding this kind of mentality will help you 
endure more and be more resilient to problems. 

Keep track of your progress towards your goal. First of all, **have a clear goal**, so you can build a path to it. 
Otherwise, any path would sound just like any other apathetic path. Having a clear goal will make your path 
shine and easy to choose. It will help you in difficult moments where you feel uncomfortable by being just a small 
piece of a machinery. You will be able to act as part of machine while you need to achieve your goal as a necessary 
step.

Focus on always keep track on your evolution on your journey to excellence. Don't compare too much yourself to the 
others, everyone is facing a different journey and everyone took different paths in their career that probably you 
didn't have the option to chose in the past. But you cannot be uncritical either, you have to analyse your progress and 
check if your current path is making you life good, you have to take a decision to change the plan or even the goal 
with the new information you learned through the current path you are pursuing.

In other point of view, you wont start your career as senior developer, so you have to build your own path. Making 
mistakes is part of the process, and that is the reason you will be gradually exposed to big things. You should 
accept yourself, don't push too hard, and do some basic stuff. Just accept the challenges of doing something not 
fancy, but relevant to build your career.

## Define and state your mission and goal
Are you a generalist or a specialist type?

What position you are looking for?

What kind of person you want to become?

## Gather information

In order to build a good portfolio, you will need to gather information about yourself and your work. In the process 
you will discover yourself. It will feels like looking to a mirror for the first time.

## Proof of your accomplishments

## Videos, photos, or lightweight web builds
