# Final project

Your portfolio should be a hosted webpage and a open repository on github.

You should follow a portfolio [structure](../03-structure/README.md), to build a [website](../07-frontend/README.md) and [host](portfolio/10-hosting/README.md) it publicly. It should have a nice [style](../05-style/README.md), a good [communication](../04-communication/README.md) is the key to execute and analyse your [strategy](../06-strategy/README.md) in order to capture insights. You can optionally increment your portfolio via [dynamic content](portfolio/11-dynamic/README.md) such as blogs or whatever you find relevant. Another extra step would be to create a generic [cover letter](portfolio/13-cover-letter/README.md) to express your intentions and goals more personally. Note that some game companies still require [CVs](portfolio/14-cv/README.md) To boost your visualization, you can [promote](portfolio/12-promoting/README.md).

Minimum steps:
1. Have a domain;
2. Create a github repository;
3. Push your frontend to the repo;
4. Enable github pages;
5. Create a CI/CD to build and deploy to gh pages;
6. Point your domain to gh-pages;
