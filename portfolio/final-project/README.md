# Final project

Your portfolio should be a hosted webpage and a open repository on github.

You should follow a portfolio [structure](../03-structure/README.md), to build a [website](../frontend/README.md) and [host](../hosting/README.md) it publicly. It should have a nice [style](../style/README.md), a good [communication](../communication/README.md) is the key to execute and analyse your [strategy](../strategy/README.md) in order to capture insights. You can optionally increment your portfolio via [dynamic content](../dynamic/README.md) such as blogs or whatever you find relevant. Another extra step would be to create a generic [cover letter](../cover-letter/README.md) to express your intentions and goals more personally. Note that some game companies still require [CVs](../cv/README.md) To boost your visualization, you can [promote](../promoting)
